You're receiving this message because you have content in a cloud.gov sandbox that is 90 days old.

Sandboxes are usable for 90 days to help you evaluate whether cloud.gov is a good fit for your needs, but they're not suitable for long-lived
or production applications.
<a href="https://cloud.gov/overview/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/">Learn more about policies for sandbox usage</a>.

We have deleted all applications, service instances, routes, etc., in the {{org.Name}}/{{space.Name}} space.
This has reset the clock; you can start a new 90-day evaluation period just by creating a new app or service
instance in the empty space.

We hope you've found the sandbox helpful.
If you'd like to host longer-lived content on cloud.gov, you'll need to do it in a different space.
To get access to a prototyping or production organization, please <a href="https://cloud.gov/docs/help/">contact us</a>, and we'll help you get set up.
