<p>You're receiving this message to confirm that we have cleared your sandbox.</p>

<p>
  We clear all sandbox contents 90 days after the first application or service is created to ensure that sandboxes aren't being used for production applications.
  You may re-deploy your application(s) after your sandbox is cleared and continue to evaluate whether cloud.gov is a good fit for your needs.
  <a href="https://cloud.gov/docs/pricing/free-limited-sandbox/">Learn more about policies for sandbox usage</a>.
</p>

<p>We have deleted all applications, service instances, routes, etc., in the test-org/test-space space.
This has reset the clock; you can start a new 90-day evaluation period just by creating a new app or service
instance in the empty space.</p>

<p>We hope you've found the sandbox helpful.
If you'd like to host longer-lived content on cloud.gov, you'll need to do it as part of a <a href="https://cloud.gov/pricing">prototyping or production package</a>.
Please <a href="https://cloud.gov/docs/help/">contact us</a> to learn how to purchase one of these packages.</p>
